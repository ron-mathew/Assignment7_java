# Assignment7_java
Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to design and implement a modular Java-based calculator application that performs basic arithmetic and advanced mathematical operations. The application should be built following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, utilize proper exception handling for robustness, and maintain clean, readable, and maintainable code structure.

Features Implemented:
Basic Operations:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division (with division-by-zero handling)

Advanced Operations:

Square

Cube

Square Root (with negative input handling)

Looped Execution:

The calculator runs continuously in a loop, allowing users to perform multiple calculations until they explicitly choose to exit.

Modular Code Design:

Each mathematical operation is implemented as a separate Java class that implements a common Calculator interface, promoting code reusability and scalability.

User Interaction:

Interactive console-based UI using Scanner for user input.

Clear menu-driven interface for selecting operations.

Exception Handling:

Built-in Java exceptions (ArithmeticException) are used to handle runtime errors like division by zero and square root of negative numbers.

General exceptions are also caught to ensure smooth execution.

Code Documentation:

Each class and method is properly commented for better understanding and future maintenance.

Conclusion:
This assignment demonstrates a practical understanding of OOP principles in Java, effective exception handling, and the importance of clean code practices. The calculator application is robust, user-friendly, and extensible for future enhancements such as trigonometric functions or file-based logging.
